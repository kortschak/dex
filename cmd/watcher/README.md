# `watcher`

`watcher` is a module that observes window, keyboard and mouse activity. Canonically it is intended for use in contextually switching device page to match the current application, but can also be used to log activity using the [`worklog`](../worklog) module.

`watcher` periodically polls the OS for active window and last activity time. The results of this are passed to a CEL evaluation as the following object:
```
{
	"time":   <timestamp>,
	"period": <duration>,

	"window_id":  <int>,
	"name":       <string>,
	"class":      <string>,
	"window":     <string>,
	"last_input": <timestamp>,
	"locked":     <bool>,
	"last": {
		"window_id":  <int>,
		"name":       <string>,
		"class":      <string>,
		"window":     <string>,
		"last_input": <timestamp>,
		"locked":     <bool>,
	},
}
```
The resulting evaluation is then send as an RPC message if it has a string field "method". If the evaluation has a field "uid" corresponding to an `rpc.UID` value the message is forwarded as a "method" notification to the daemon identified by that UID. Otherwise it is passed to the kernel to handle.

Example configuration fragment that pages to the "dev" page when "sublime_text" or "sublime_merge" is the active window (requires a kernel configuration fragment with an additional service â€” below):
```
# Watcher module component: get active window and activity.
[module.watcher]
path = "watcher"
log_mode = "log"
log_level = "info"
log_add_source = false

[module.watcher.options]
polling = "1s"

rules.paging = """
{
	"sublime_text":  "dev",
	"sublime_merge": "dev",
}.as(page_for, !(last.name in page_for || name in page_for) || page_for[?name] == page_for[?last.name] ? {} : {
	"method": "page",
	"params": {
		"page":    name in page_for ? page_for[name] : "default",
		"service": {"service":"kernel_pager"}
	},
})
```

This depends on a kernel service to assign a device. This can be set up in the kernel configuration by adding the following lines.
```
[service.kernel_pager]
serial = ""
```
Where `serial` is either default or the target device's serial.

See the example for the [`worklog`](../worklog) to see how a non-kernel call is handled.

## CEL optional types

The CEL environment enables the CEL [optional types library](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/cel-go/cel#OptionalTypes), [version 1](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/cel-go/cel#OptionalTypesVersion).
